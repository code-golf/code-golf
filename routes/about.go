		"<dt>Do I Need to Login to Play?" +
		"<dd>No. Submitted solutions will be executed and checked without " +
		"logging in, but nothing will be saved and you won't appear on the " +
		"<a href=scores>leaderboards</a>." +
		"<dt>What Languages Are Supported?" +

		"<p>If you'd like to see another language added then raise an " +
		"<a href=//github.com/JRaspass/code-golf/issues/new>issue</a>." +
		"<dt>Are Warnings Ignored?" +
		"<dd>Yes. Only STDOUT is checked against the solution, STDERR is " +
		"however shown back to you to ease debugging." +
		"<dt>How Are Arguments Passed to My Program?" +
		"<dd>Some holes pass arguments, for those your program should read " +
		"them from ARGV." +
		"<dt>How Are Solutions Scored?" +
		"<dd>The score of your solution is the count of the Unicode characters " +
		"in your source code. This means both " +
		`"A" (U+0041 Latin Capital Letter A) and "ðŸ˜‰" (U+1F609 Winking Face) ` +
		"cost the same despite the 1:4 ratio in byte count in UTF-8." +
		"<dt>How Is My Overall Score Computed?" +
		"<dd>For each hole, the shortest solution is awarded 100 points, " +
		"with the points descreasing in uniform decrements per rank. " +
		"Your overall score is simply the sum of your points in each hole." +
		"<dt>Are Submissions Resource Constrained?" +
		"<dd>Yes. Execution time is limited to 5 seconds, CPU & RAM usage " +
		"is unbounded but this will probably change soon." +
		"<dt>Can I See Other People's Solutions?" +
		"<dd>Currently no, but a feature is in development to allow you to " +
		"see any solution that you already beaten in score." +

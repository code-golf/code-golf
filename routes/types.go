		"Given a series of ten-pin bowling scoreboards, determine the final scores based on the <a href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Traditional_scoring>traditional scoring method</a>.<p>A game consists of ten frames. Each frame, players get up to two rolls to knock down all ten pins.<p>If a player gets a strike in the final frame, they get two extra rolls. If they get a strike in one of the first nine frames, the value of the following two rolls, which may cover multiple frames, is added as a bonus.<p>If a player gets a spare in the final frame, they get one extra roll. If they get a spare in one of the first nine frames, the value of the following roll is added as a bonus.</p><p>Each argument represents one game of bowling for one player. For each roll, a single character represents the number of pins knocked down. Frames are separated by spaces. The following symbols are used.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Symbol<th>Description<tbody><tr><th>X<td>Strike - all ten pins were knocked down on the first roll of a frame, or the bonus rolls of the final frame.<tr><th>/<td>Spare - all remaining pins were knocked down on the second roll of a frame, or the second bonus roll of the final frame.<tr><th>F<td>Foul - part of the bowler’s body went past the foul line.<tr><th>-<td>Miss - No pins were knocked down.<tr><th>⑤⑥⑦⑧<td>Split - the foremost pin is knocked down and there is a gap of at least one pin between the pins that remain standing.</table></div><p>Output the total score for each game on a separate line. The total score is the total number of pins knocked down plus strike and spare bonuses.</p>",

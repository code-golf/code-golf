<p>
    The variation we use is played with a standard 52-card deck, with integers
    ranging from 1 to 13. Print all solvable quadruples of integers. The

    Connect Four is a solved strategy game in which two players take turns

    drops the red checkers is always the first to take action, and in theory

    checkers are dropped in strategic locations. The first player to complete a
    horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four connected checkers wins the

    wins and print <b><code>Red</code></b> or <b><code>Yellow</code></b>.
    Additionally, print <b><code>Draw</code></b> if no row of four connected
    checkers is complete when both players have used all their checkers; or

<p>
    When using the grid layout in CSS, divs are placed in a particular way.
    Each div can span a number of rows and columns. With the default settings,
    div must come after the previous one in flow order, so when placing a div
    the browser will look for the first spot that would fit and comes after
    the previous div.

<p>
    You will be given the number of columns, a space, then a series of
    <code>w,h</code> pairs representing the row and column span of each div.

<p>
    Output the column and row coordinates of the top-left corner of each box,
    starting from 0 0, all on one line. Each pair of numbers is seperated by a
    comma.

<p>The grid has infinite height.

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Given this input:

<pre>4 2,1 3,1 1,2 4,1</pre>

<p>
    We know the width is 4, and the boxes are
    <code>[2,1], [3,1], [1,2], [4,1]</code>

<p>Greedily aranging the boxes gives us this:

<pre>
┏━━━┓
┃ ┆ ┃
┣━━━┻━┳━┓
┃ ┆ ┆ ┃ ┃
┗━━━━━┫┄┃
      ┃ ┃
┏━━━━━┻━┫
┃ ┆ ┆ ┆ ┃
┗━━━━━━━┛
</pre>

<p>
    Note that the third long box could fix on the third row, however, that
    would not preserve ordering so we must place it on the second row.

<p>So we output the coordinates of the top left corners:

0,0 0,1 3,1 0,3

preamble = '''
<p>
    A <strong>deterministic finite automaton</strong> or DFA is a
    finite-state machine that moves between states as it reads characters
    from a string.

<p>
    Each input consists of a table describing the DFA, and a quoted input
    string, like so:

<pre>
    a b c d e f
> 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
  1 0 0 0 1 0 2
  2 3 0 0 1 0 0
 F3 3 3 3 3 3 3
"adbacadafad"
</pre>

<p>In this table, we can find the following information:

<ul>
    <li>
        There are four states, called <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>,
        <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>.

        <ul>
            <li>
                States are always digits <code>0-9</code>.
                There may be up to 10 states.
        </ul>

    <li>
        There are six characters in the input alphabet: <code>a</code>,
        <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>d</code>, <code>e</code>, and
        <code>f</code>.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Input characters may be lowercase letters <code>a-z</code> or
                digits <code>0-9</code>.
        </ul>

    <li>
        The table entries describe the new state for each (current state,
        character) pair.

        <ul>
            <li>
                For example, if the current state is <code>0</code>, and a
                <code>d</code> is read, the next state is <code>1</code>.
        </ul>

    <li>
        The row describing state <code>0</code> is marked with
        <code>&gt;</code> so it is the <strong>initial state</strong>.
        There is exactly one initial state.

    <li>
        The row describing state <code>3</code> is marked with
        <code>F</code> so it is an <strong>accept state</strong>.
        There may be multiple accept states, or none at all.
</ul>

<p>
    Use the table to move the DFA between its states by feeding it
    characters from the input string.

<p>In our example:

<ul>
    <li>
        The initial state is <code>0</code>. The first character is
        <code>a</code>. Looking at the table, we see the new state is
        <code>0</code>.
    <li>
        The current state is <code>0</code>. The next character is
        <code>d</code>. Looking at the table, we see the new state is
        <code>1</code>.
    <li>
        The current state is <code>1</code>. The next character is
        <code>b</code>. Looking at the table, we see the new state is
        <code>0</code>.
    <li>
        …
</ul>

<p>
    Finally, print the name of the state, followed by a space, followed
    by either <code>Accept</code> (if it is an accept state) or
    <code>Reject</code> (otherwise). In this case, we end in state
    <code>1</code> so we print <code>1 Reject</code>.

        Triads of notes will always be written out so that the letters in the

        Therefore, a triad consisting of notes 3, 6, and 9 may be written as
        <b>B♯ D♯ F♯</b> or <b>C E♭ G♭</b>, but not, for example, as
        <b>C D♯ F♯</b>.
    <li>
        The notes may appear in any order, e.g., <b>C E G</b> and <b>E C G</b>
        both may appear.

preamble = '''
<p>
    A <strong>nondeterministic finite automaton</strong> or NFA is a
    finite-state machine that may nondeterministically move to any
    of a set of states as it reads characters from a string.

<p>
    Each input consists of a table describing the NFA, and a quoted input
    string, like so:

<pre>
    | a | b | c |
→ 0 |{0}|{0}|{0,1}|
  1 |{2}| ∅ | ∅ |
  2 | ∅ |{3}| ∅ |
 F3 | ∅ | ∅ | ∅ |
acbcab
</pre>

<p>In this table, we can find the following information:

<ul>
    <li>
        There are four states, called <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>,
        <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>.

        <ul>
            <li>
                States are always digits <code>0-9</code>.
                There may be up to 10 states.
        </ul>

    <li>
        There are three characters in the input alphabet: <code>a</code>,
        <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Input characters may be lowercase letters <code>a-z</code> or
                digits <code>0-9</code>.
        </ul>

    <li>
        The table entries describe the set of states the NFA may transition to
        for each (current state, character) pair.

        <ul>
            <li>
                For example, if the current state is <code>0</code>,
                and a c is read, the set of possible next states is {0,1}.
        </ul>

    <li>
        The row describing state <code>0</code> is marked with
        <code>→</code> so it is the <strong>initial state</strong>.
        There is exactly one initial state.

    <li>
        The row describing state <code>3</code> is marked with
        <code>F</code> so it is an <strong>accept state</strong>.
        There may be multiple accept states, or none at all.
</ul>

<p>
    Use the table to move the NFA between sets of valid states by feeding it
    characters from the input string. Once the set of possible states is the
    empty set, it remains so.

<p>In our example:

<ul>
    <li>
        The initial state is <code>0</code>. The first character is
        <code>a</code>. Looking at the table, we see the new set of possible
        states is <code>{0}</code>, so the NFA must be in state <code>0</code>.

    <li>
        The current state is <code>0</code>. The next character is
        <code>c</code>. Looking at the table, we see that the set of possible
        next states is <code>{0,1}</code>. Thus, the NFA may
        nondeterministically move to either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.
        Or, alternatively, its set of possible locations is <code>{0,1}</code>.

    <li>
        The current state is either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. The next
        character is <code>b</code>. Looking at the table, we see that if the
        state had been <code>0</code>, it can be <code>0</code> next, while if
        it had been <code>1</code>, it has no next state -- and that
        computation path dies. Thus, the set of reachable states after seeing
        substring <code>acb</code> is <code>{0,1}</code>.
</ul>

<p>
    Finally, print on <b>separate lines</b> the set of reachable states after
    processing the entirety of <b>each</b> input string, followed by a space,
    followed by either <code>Accept</code> (if the NFA can reach any accept
    state by processing the string, or, in other words, if the final set of
    valid states contains an accept state) or <code>Accept</code> (otherwise).
    In this case, we may end at either <code>0</code> or <code>3</code> and
    one of them is an accept state (<code>3</code>), so we print
    <code>{0,3} Accept</code>.

<p>
    There may be multiple input strings presented on separate lines; print
    their respective outputs on separate lines. When printing a set, sort its
    elements numerically and use <code>∅</code> to denote the empty set. The
    empty string in the input is denoted by <code>ε</code>.

<p>
    A <b>p</b>-adic integer is an integer written in base <b>p</b> with an
    infinite number of digits:
    <code>…a<sub>2</sub>a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>0</sub></code>.
    Every rational number <b>r</b> with denominator not divisible by <b>p</b>
    is a <b>p</b>-adic integer (in other words, <b>r</b> has a
    <i><b>p</b>-adic expansion</i>). For example, the <b>5</b>-adic expansion
    of <b>17</b> is <code>…00032</code>.

<p>
    The digits <b>a<sub>i</sub> (i = 0…∞)</b> of the <b>p</b>-adic expansion
    of <b>r</b> can be obtained by repeating the following steps:

<ol>
    <li>
        Find the only integer <b>a<sub>i</sub></b> between <b>0</b> and

        Replace <b>r</b> with <b>(r − a<sub>i</sub>)/p</b>.
</ol>

<p>
    Note: The first <b>k</b> digits of the p-adic expansion of a rational
    number <b>a/b</b> can also be found by computing <b>a×b<sup>-1</sup></b>
    modulo <b>p<sup>k</sup></b>.

<p>
    The p-adic expansion of a rational number is periodic.
    <i>Quote notation</i> uses a single quote (') to mean that the digits to

    Each argument is an SI unit with a possible prefix. Print it as a product of a
    power of ten and its base units. For example, <code>GW</code> (gigawatt) becomes
    <code>10^9 kg m^2 s^-3</code>. Keep in mind the following exceptions:

<ul>
    <li>
        The kilogram is a base unit with an inherent prefix. Other prefixes attach
        to <b>g</b> (gram), and you should print their values relative to the
        kilogram: <code>g</code> is <code>10^-3 kg</code> and <code>Mg</code>
        is <code>10^3 kg</code>.
    <li>
        Instead of <code>10^1</code>, print <code>10</code>.
    <li>
        Instead of <code>10^0</code>, print <code>1</code>.
    <li>
        For <b>rad</b> and <b>sr</b>, only print a power of ten. (Example: for
        <code>Mrad</code>, print <code>10^6</code>, not <code>10^6 1</code>.)
    <li>
        There is no universal order among the base units. For <b>C</b>, you must
        output <code>A s</code> rather than <code>s A</code>. We follow the
        conventions of <a href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/special-publication-330/sp-330-section-2#2.3.4">NIST</a>.
    <li>
        <code>μ</code> is U+03BC GREEK SMALL LETTER MU (UTF-8: <code>ce bc</code>).

        <code>Ω</code> is U+03A9 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (UTF-8: <code>ce a9</code>).

<p>
    Snake is a video game in which the player controls a snake-like creature
    that grows longer as it consumes objects scattered on the screen. When the
    ever-growing creature collides with obstacles, terrain boundaries, or
    itself, the game is over.

<p>
    Each argument is a series of the creature's movements: <b>left</b>,
    <b>right</b>, and <b>forward</b>, denoted by <b>L</b>, <b>R</b>, and
    <b>F</b> respectively. The snake always starts its track in the upper left
    corner, facing east. Furthermore, it never intersects itself and leaves no
    terrain along the north and west sides, both of which would end the game.

<p>
    For example, <code>FFFRFFLFFFFLFLFF</code> indicates the snake's movements
    are:

<ul>
    <li>Move three cells forward
    <li>Turn right, facing south
    <li>Move two cells forward

        A line containing the initial indentation <b>I</b> and the initial

    <li>
        Several lines of text, each representing a paragraph of the output.
</ul>

<p>Split the text into centred lines that get progressively longer as follows:

<p>
    The first line starts with <b>I</b> spaces and should contain as many words
    as you can fit in <b>W</b> characters (so lines may only be wrapped where
    there are spaces in the input).

<p>
    If the resulting line contains fewer than <b>W</b> characters, pad out the
    line by adding spaces between the words as evenly as possible to get to
    <b>W</b> characters in total. If some gaps require extra spaces, add them
    starting from the left. Example:

<pre>May the Force be with you!</pre>

<p>
    This line contains 26 characters and has 5 gaps. If we had <b>W = 33</b>,
    the result should look like:

<pre>May   the   Force  be  with  you!</pre>

<p>
    After every pair of lines, reduce <b>I</b> by 1 and increase <b>W</b> by 2.
    Continue this way through all of the input. The last line of each paragraph
    should <em>not</em> be justified (i.e. don't add any spaces to it). And
    paragraphs should be separated by an empty line that does count towards the
    progression of <b>I</b> and <b>W</b>.

<p>
    This hole contains multiple test cases (one argument per test case). Separate
    the output for multiple test cases by an empty line.

<p>
    Given a series of ten-pin bowling scoreboards, determine the final scores
    based on the
    <a href=//www.wikihow.com/Score-Bowling>traditional scoring method</a>.

<p>
    A game consists of ten frames. Each frame, players get up to two rolls to
    knock down all ten pins.

<p>
    If a player gets a strike in the final frame, they get two extra rolls. If
    they get a strike in one of the first nine frames, the value of the
    following two rolls, which may cover multiple frames, is added as a bonus.

<p>
    If a player gets a spare in the final frame, they get one extra roll. If
    they get a spare in one of the first nine frames, the value of the
    following roll is added as a bonus.

<p>
    Each argument represents one game of
    bowling for one player. For each roll, a single character represents the
    number of pins knocked down. Frames are separated by spaces. The following
    symbols are used.

    an edge from node <b>u</b> to node <b>v</b> is given as <code>u v</code>.
    The nodes are numbered from <b>0</b> to <b>N - 1</b>, where <b>2 ≤ N ≤
    10</b> is the number of nodes in the graph.

<p>
    This is similar to the <code>tsort</code> utility, except that output nodes
    are separated with spaces instead of newlines.

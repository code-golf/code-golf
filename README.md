# Code Golf

This is the repository behind https://code-golf.io

## Quickstart

1. Install mkcert:
```
$ yay mkcert
```

2. Install the local CA:
```
$ make cert
Using the local CA at "~/.local/share/mkcert" ‚ú®
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ‚ö°Ô∏è
The local CA is now installed in the Firefox and/or Chrome/Chromium trust store (requires browser restart)! ü¶ä


Created a new certificate valid for the following names üìú
 - "localhost"

The certificate is at "./localhost.pem" and the key at "./localhost-key.pem" ‚úÖ
```

3. Build the assets:
```
$ ./build-assets
```

4. Build the languages:
Using the pull option pulls images from Docker Hub, instead of building them locally, which saves a large amount of time (possibly hours).
```
$ ./build-langs --pull
```

5. Bring up the website:
```
$ make dev
```

6. Navigate to https://localhost

## Testing

1. Run the unit tests:
```
$ go test ./...
```

2. Run the e2e tests:
```
$ prove
```

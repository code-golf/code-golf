Come on everybody
I say now let's play a game
I betcha I can make a rhyme, out of anybody's name
The first letter of the name, I treat it like it wasn't there
But a "B" or an "F", or an "M" will appear
And then I say "Bo", add a "B", then I say the name
Then "bonana fanna" and "fo"
And then I say the name again with an "F" very plain
Then a "fee fy" and a "mo"
And then I say the name again with an "M" this time
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme.

Arnold!
Arnold, Arnold, bo Barnold
Bonana fanna fo Farnold
Fee fy mo Marnold, Arnold!

But if the first two letters are ever the same
I drop them both, then say the name
Like Bob, Bob, drop the "B's", Bo-ob
Or Fred, Fred, drop the "F's", Fo-red
Or Mary, Mary, drop the "M's", Mo-ary
That's the only rule that is contrary
Okay?

Now say Bo
Bo!
Now Tony with a "B"
Bony!
Then "bonana fanna" and "fo"
Bonana fanna fo!
Then you say the name again with an "F" very plain
Fony!
Then a "fee fy" and a "mo"
Fee fy mo!
Then you say the name again with an "M" this time
Mony!
And there isn't any name that you can't rhyme.

Everybody do Tony!
Tony, Tony, bo Bony
Bonana fanna fo Fony
Fee fy mo Mony, Tony!

Pretty good, let's do Billy!
Billy, Billy, Bo-gilly
Bonana fanna fo Filly
Fee fy mo Milly, Billy!

        <dt>Do I Need to Log in to Play?
        <dd>
            No. Submitted solutions will be executed and checked without
            logging in, but nothing will be saved and you won't appear on the
            <a href=rankings/holes/all/all/bytes>leaderboards</a>.

        <dt>Are Warnings Ignored?
        <dd>
            Yes. Only STDOUT is checked against the solution, STDERR is
            however shown back to you to ease debugging.

        <dt>How Are Arguments Passed to My Program?
        <dd>
            Some holes pass arguments, for those your program should read them
            from the command line arguments (ARGV).

        <dt>How Are Solutions Ranked?
        <dd>
            There are two scorings in use, bytes and chars. Bytes is the
            number of bytes of a solution encoded in UTF-8. Chars is the
            number of Unicode codepoints of a solution. Users may submit up to
            two solutions per hole per language. This is handled automatically
            when you enter two solutions and each minimizes a different
            scoring. Each scoring has its own set of leaderboards. For the
            chars scoring, both ‚ÄúA‚Äù (U+0041 Latin Capital Letter A) and ‚Äúüòâ‚Äù
            (U+1F609 Winking Face) cost the same despite the 1:4 ratio in byte
            count in UTF-8.

        <dt>How Are Solutions Scored?
        <dd>
            For each hole, in each language, up to 1,000 points are available.
            The formula is:
            <blockquote>
                <i>Points</i> =
                    <i>S<sub>b</sub></i> √∑ <i>S<sub>u</sub></i> √ó 1000
            </blockquote>
            Where <i>S<sub>u</sub></i> is the length of the user's solution,
            and <i>S<sub>b</sub></i> is a Bayesian estimator of the form:
            <blockquote>
                <i>S<sub>b</sub></i> = ((<i>‚àön</i> + 2) √∑ (<i>‚àön</i> + 3))
                    √ó <i>S</i> + (1 √∑ (<i>‚àön</i> + 3)) √ó <i>S<sub>a</sub></i>
            </blockquote>
            <i>n</i> is the number of solutions in this hole in this language.
            <i>S</i> is the length of the shortest solution in this hole in
            this language.
            <i>S<sub>a</sub></i> is the shortest solution among all languages
            in this hole.

            <p>
                The confidence interval is chosen such that the shortest
                solution in any language will receive a score of at least 750.

            <p>
                Your overall score is the sum of your highest points in each
                hole.

        <dt>Are Submissions Resource Constrained?
        <dd>
            Yes. Execution time is limited to 5 seconds, CPU & RAM usage is
            unbounded but this will probably change soon. The length of each
            solution must be lower than 128 KiB as that's the maximum length
            of any program argument under Linux.

        <dt>Is There an API?
        <dd>
            An API is currently being developed and documented in standard
            <a href="https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://code.golf/api">
                OpenAPI format</a>.
            A legacy API that just returns scores in JSON exists. The URL is
            <a href=/scores/all-holes/all-langs/all>
                /scores/all-holes/all-langs/all</a>.
            Note that all-holes and all-langs may be replaced by the names of
            specific holes and languages.

        <dt>Can I See Other People's Solutions?
        <dd>
            No, that way all holes stay competitive. If you're stuck on how to
            shave a couple of strokes off your solution then why not visit
            <a href=//discord.gg/eVCTkYQ>our Discord server</a> for some advice.

        <dt>Do I Need to Log in to Play?
        <dd>
            No. Submitted solutions will be executed and checked without
            logging in, but nothing will be saved and you won't appear on the
            <a href=scores/all-holes/all-langs>leaderboards</a>.

        <dt>Is Code Golf Free as in Speech?

        <dd>
            <p>
                Yes! However hosting isn't, so if you enjoy Code Golf consider
                donating to its continued existence and improvement via
                <a href=//github.com/sponsors/JRaspass>GitHub Sponsors</a>.

                Sponsors will receive a shiny ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù badge on their profile

        <dt>Are Warnings Ignored?
        <dd>
            Yes. Only STDOUT is checked against the solution, STDERR is
            however shown back to you to ease debugging.

        <dt>How Are Arguments Passed to My Program?
        <dd>
            Some holes pass arguments, for those your program should read them
            from ARGV.

        <dt>How Are Solutions Scored?
        <dd>
            There are two scorings in use, bytes and chars. Bytes is the
            number of bytes of a solution encoded in UTF-8. Chars is the
            number of Unicode codepoints of a solution. Users may submit up to
            two solutions per hole per language. This is handled automatically
            when you enter two solutions and each minimizes a different
            scoring. Each scoring has its own set of leaderboards. For the
            chars scoring, both ‚ÄúA‚Äù (U+0041 Latin Capital Letter A) and ‚Äúüòâ‚Äù
            (U+1F609 Winking Face) cost the same despite the 1:4 ratio in byte
            count in UTF-8.

        <dt>How Is My Overall Score Computed?
        <dd>
            For each hole, the shortest solution is awarded 1,000 points, with
            the points descreasing in uniform decrements per rank. Your
            overall score is simply the sum of your points in each hole.

        <dt>Are Submissions Resource Constrained?
        <dd>
            Yes. Execution time is limited to 7 seconds, CPU & RAM usage is
            unbounded but this will probably change soon. The maximum length
            of each solution is 400 KiB.

        <dt>Is there an API?
        <dd>There is a read-only API that returns scores in JSON format. The
            URL is<a href=/scores/all-holes/all-langs/all>
            /scores/all-holes/all-langs/all</a>. Note that all-holes and
            all-langs may be replaced by the names of specific holes and
            languages.

        <dt>Can I See Other People's Solutions?
        <dd>
            No, that way all holes stay competitive. If you're stuck on how to
            shave a couple of bytes off your solution then why not drop by
            <a href=//discord.gg/eVCTkYQ>our Discord server</a> for some advice.

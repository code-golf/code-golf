        <dt>Do I Need to Log in to Play?
        <dd>
            No. Submitted solutions will be executed and checked without
            logging in, but nothing will be saved and you won't appear on the
            <a href=scores/all-holes/all-langs>leaderboards</a>.

        <dt>Is the Project Open Source?
        <dd>
            Yes. It is written in <a href=//golang.org>Go</a> and available on
            <a href=//github.com/code-golf/code-golf>GitHub</a>; patches welcome!

        <dt>Are Warnings Ignored?
        <dd>
            Yes. Only STDOUT is checked against the solution, STDERR is
            however shown back to you to ease debugging.

        <dt>How Are Arguments Passed to My Program?
        <dd>
            Some holes pass arguments, for those your program should read them
            from ARGV.

        <dt>How Are Solutions Scored?
        <dd>
            The score of your solution is the count of the Unicode characters
            in your source code. This means both “A” (U+0041 Latin Capital
            Letter A) and “😉” (U+1F609 Winking Face) cost the same despite
            the 1:4 ratio in byte count in UTF-8.

        <dt>How Is My Overall Score Computed?
        <dd>
            For each hole, the shortest solution is awarded 1,000 points, with
            the points descreasing in uniform decrements per rank. Your
            overall score is simply the sum of your points in each hole.

        <dt>Are Submissions Resource Constrained?
        <dd>
            Yes. Execution time is limited to 5 seconds, CPU & RAM usage is
            unbounded but this will probably change soon.

        <dt>Can I See Other People's Solutions?
        <dd>
            Currently no, but a feature is in development to allow you to see
            any solution that you already beaten in score.

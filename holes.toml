['Ten-pin Bowling']

preamble = '''
<p>
    Given a series of ten-pin bowling scoreboards, determine the final scores
    based on the
    <a href=//www.wikihow.com/Score-Bowling>traditional scoring method</a>.

<p>
    A game consists of ten frames. Each frame, players get up to two rolls to
    knock down all ten pins.

<p>
    If a player gets a strike in the final frame, they get two extra rolls. If
    they get a strike in one of the first nine frames, the value of the
    following two rolls, which may cover multiple frames, is added as a bonus.

<p>
    If a player gets a spare in the final frame, they get one extra roll. If
    they get a spare in one of the first nine frames, the value of the
    following roll is added as a bonus.<p>Each argument represents one game of
    bowling for one player. For each roll, a single character represents the
    number of pins knocked down. Frames are separated by spaces. The following
    symbols are used.

<div>

                    of a frame, or the bonus rolls of the final frame. A
                    strike in the first nine frames is represented by a space
                    followed by an X, as if the strike happened on the frame’s
                    second roll, even though the frame consists of a single
                    roll.

                    frame.

                    standing.
